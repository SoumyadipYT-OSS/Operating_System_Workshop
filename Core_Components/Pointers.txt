__C pointers__
Pointers are one of the core components of the C programming language.
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. 
Pointers are used to manipulate data using the address of the 
data instead of the data itself.

>> example1:	int *p;
[-] This declares a pointer p of type int. The * operator is used to declare a pointer. Here '*' symbol is called asterick.
			
					
>> example2: 	int var = 5;
		int *p;
		p = &var;
[-] This assigns the address of 'var' to the pointer 'p'. To access the value stored at the address pointed to by a pointer, you can use the asterick(*) operator.


>> example3:	int var=5;
		int *p;
		p = &var;
		*p = 10;
		printf("%d", var);
[-] This will print 10, which is the new value of 'var'.
